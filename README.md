# Simple QR-Codes Generator :D
Generates QR-codes, nothing more and nothing less >.<
## How to use
Just run ```./install.sh``` to set all the dependencies up, then u can use the tool. 
Here is a sample command ```$ python3 QRstuff.py -s "Banana" -sh=True```: the first paramenter is the string that the program will put into the qr-code, the ```-sh``` option is actually optional, it uses a python lib (climage) that allows you to display images on the terminal (and I think this is awesome) so the qr-code will be displayed in real-time on the terminal (it'll not work if you try to scan it btw, only the .png file will work properly x] )
